# Metronomic

A WatchKit app to demonstrate using the Taptic Engine as a metronome

I am a little late on [my promise to @erica](https://twitter.com/barbecuesteve/status/607984069788499969) but here it is. 

You'll note that the haptic feedback is not tightly coupled to time; the metronome is kind of all over the place.

The important bits are [here](Taptronome%20Extension/InterfaceController.m).
